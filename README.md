# SpaceCats App

## Overview

The SpaceCats Library app is a React Native application developed with Expo. This project is solely for my training purposes to improve my skills in React Native, TypeScript, using REST APIs, and Expo. The app was not developed for public use.

## Objective

The main goal of this app is to give me the opportunity to try out different technologies and development skills. The application allows me to retrieve cat images, GIFs, and memes from an external API. There is no intention to use the app for commercial or public purposes.

## Functionalities

### 1. Image Retrieval
The app allows me to pull cat images, GIFs, and memes from an external API. For this idea, I used the free version of the cat API from [thecatapi.com](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4016432/RWToRJCq).

### 2. Evaluation Function
There is an option to rate images to express my preferences for certain content.

### 3. Comment Function
The app allows me to record my thoughts and comments on the images I retrieve.
