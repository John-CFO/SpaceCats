# SpaceCats app

## Overview

The SpaceCats Library app is a React Native application developed with Expo. This project is solely for my training purposes to improve my skills in React Native, TypeScript,, Node,js, Express.js as well as using REST APIs and Expo. The app was not developed for public use.

## Goal setting

The main goal of this app is to give me the opportunity to try out different technologies and development skills. The application allows one to retrieve cat images, GIFs and memes from an external API. There is no intention to use the app for commercial or public purposes.

## Functionalities

### 1. Image retrieval
The app allows fetching cat images, GIFs and memes from an external API. For this idea I used the free version of the Cat API from [thecatapi.com](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4016432/RWToRJCq).

### 2. Rating function
There is an option to rate images and comments to express your preferences for certain content.

### 3. Comment function
The app allows you to leave your thoughts as a comment
(there is no storage option as a cloud service) as this is just a practice project.
